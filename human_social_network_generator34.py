    Returns a network of a specified degree distribution where clustering

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : (int, int)
        Tuple of grid dimensions. Number of nodes in network is grid[0]*grid[1]
    geodesic : float
        Desired average shortest path length / degrees of separation (geodesic).

        Distribution function from which to draw probability of connection / migration values.
    args : arguments

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm works by creating a grid where nodes are connected to their neighbors
    to the North, South, East, and West. The top and bottom of the grid and left and right
    are connected to form a torus, ensuring all nodes have the same number of edges initially.
    Each node has a probability of 'migrating', referred to as 'extraversion'
    (which is one source of this probability), drawn from the connect_dist
    distribution.
    If two nodes are at the same grid position, an edge is created between
    these two nodes.
    This typically results in realistic network parameters. The process can continue until the desired
    geodesic value is reached.
